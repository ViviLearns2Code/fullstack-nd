# Movie Trailer Website
This website features a selection of interesting movies. 
For this project, I used Python 2.7.13 to create the website which is then opened in the browser. For website layout and interaction, I used CSS and JavaScript. 

## Features
The website displays each movie tile with a poster. When you hover over the movie tile, the respective movie details (title, year, plot) are displayed. It is possible to open the movie trailer in a popup.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://vivilearns2code.github.io/MovieWebsite/).

## Download
You need to have Python 2.7.13 installed on your machine. 

The application contains the following files:
* `fresh_tomatoes.py` - generates HTML file
* `initData.py` - creates movies and opens website
* `media.py` - contains the movie class structure
* `index.html` - generated after running initData.py

Clone the repository into your local directory. Open the file `initData.py` in IDLE and press F5. Alternatively, open your command line, change directory to your cloned local repository and enter `python initData.py`.
